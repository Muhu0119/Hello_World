            <p>Ontario’s housing market faced a slow 2023 as the province ended the year with the lowest number ofannual
                sales since 2001. While Ontario’s December home sales are up 2.4% compared to December 2022,sales were
                well below the 10-year average for the month of December, with 7,723 sales in December 2023.</p>
            
            <p>The average Ontario home sold price in   December 2023 saw a strong increase of 5% from December
                2022,bringing the average house price in Ontario to $853,915. That’s up 2.4% from last month. In
                contrast,the annual 2023 average price came in at $872,312, a 6% decline from 2022’s annual average
                price.
                Looking at another measure of prices, the benchmark home price for a "typical" home in Ontario was
                $851,000, down 1.2% month-over-month and down 0.5% from last year.</p>

            <p>Nationally, Canada's housing market is seeing similar price gains, with the national average price
                experiencing an increase of 5% year-over-year, at $657,145 in December 2023, which is also a 2% monthly
                increase.</p>

            <p>There was quite a positive upswing in active residential listings, which increased by 19% from December
                2022 to 30,100 – the highest number of active listings in five years for December. Meanwhile, new
                residential listings dropped slightly, with 8,960 new listings, a decrease of 6% from December 2022.</p>

            <p>The sales-to-new-listings ratio (SNLR) in December 2023 was recorded at 86%. This ratio represents a
                seller’s market, which has an SNLR of over 60%, and indicates that there is more buyer demand than
                seller supply in the housing market. However, the SNLR typically spikes in December as sellers hold off
                on listing their homes.</p>

            <p>Looking at Ontario’s major urban housing markets in terms of annual price changes for December 2023, many
                cities are still seeing higher home prices compared to last year. The exception is Oshawa and
                Mississauga, with Oshawa’s housing market seeing prices 6% lower compared to the same month last year,
                while Mississauga home prices are down 3% year-over-year.</p>
            <p>Many urban housing markets in Ontario are still seeing year-over-year increases in average home prices,
                such as Brampton (+0.5%), Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge (+3%), and Ottawa (+4%). In London, home prices
                are up 2.5% year-over-year. The City of Toronto has seen prices increase 4% year-over-year.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Ontario housing market continues to experience a mix of trends and varying levels of
                activity, with some regions seeing modest growth while others are experiencing declines.</p>

    <div class="row pb-5">
        <div class="col pt-2 pb-3">
            <p>Lontario’s housing market saw a sharp correction in prices in 2022 as Bank of Canada rate hikes brought
                about rising interest rates, stifling demand. Looking forward, Ontario’s housing market forecast for
                2023 depends on a few factors.</p>

            <p>A pause in Bank of Canada rate hikes, something that is widely predicted as inflation eases off and as
                the risk of a recession increases, might even translate into rate cuts this year. Immigration, looking
                mainly at newcomers and international students, has also been returning to normal levels. More people
                looking for a home will boost demand. Met with a shortage in housing inventory, a surge in buyers will
                introduce upward pressure on housing prices.</p>

            <p>The federal government banned foreign buyers from buying a home in Canada, starting in 2023. Should
                interest rates continue to increase, demand will be crippled further.</p>
